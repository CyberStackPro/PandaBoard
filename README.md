# 🐼 PandaBoard — Open Source Notion Alternative

PandaBoard is a **modern, full-stack, open-source alternative to Notion**, built for developers, writers, and teams who want full control over their data and workflows.

It supports workspace organization, nested pages, a rich-text block editor, authentication, and planned real-time collaboration—all powered by cutting-edge web technologies like **Next.js**, **NestJS**, **Lexical**, and **PostgreSQL**.

> Self-host it, customize it, or contribute. PandaBoard is designed to be the fastest way to build your own Notion-style app.
